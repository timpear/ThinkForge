# ThinkForge High-Concept Zero-D Printing System

The ThinkForge High-Concept Zero-D Printing System revolutionizes creative productivity by liberating your ideas from the digital and physical environment.

Your new ThinkForge printer works with every file format, from text documents to 3D object files to videos. It is open source and compatible with all operating systems. It employs a non-toxic, cost-free, zero-footprint fabrication process, for both the prints and the printer itself.

Additionally, you won't waste any time on setup. The drivers? Already installed. The printer? Good to go right now!

To use the ThinkForge printer, locate the file you wish to print. This can be a file on your desktop computer, laptop, tablet, phone, pad of paper, or even your brain. Think: "OK, PRINT!" Now look outside. See that cloud? Your print is in that cloud!

Time to take a break. Maybe make some tea. If you have a cat or dog, scratch it behind the ears.

OK, picture your 0D print. How does it look? Nice! Now take a look at the cloud again. Does it look the same as before? No? It's working! Now picture your 0D print again, from the other side. Take a walk. Excellent. And remember, your print can be accessed from anywhere.

When you have finished examining your print, you can recycle the materials by simply not thinking about it anymore. The printer will power-down automatically, again, by not thinking about it anymore.

The ThinkForge High-Concept Zero-D Printing System works best when used at regular intervals. Also, don't forget to drink plenty of water.


## Troubleshooting:

**You do not see your printer.**
ThinkForge has a sleek clutter-free zero-footprint design, and occupies no physical space.

**There are no clouds in the sky.**
There's a cloud somewhere, out of sight.

**It is completely overcast.**
No problem. Honestly, ThinkForge works just fine without any clouds. Don't worry about the clouds.

**You want words printed on paper, or an object printed with plastic.**
Listen, your project is in great shape. Stop working on it for a while.

**Your project is not in great shape.**
Listen, your project is not in great shape, but you've got a fine-looking print regardless. What more do you want?
